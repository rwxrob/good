# ðŸŒ³Common Go Tasks

This is a collection of common `go` commands that I've put into a command branch for inclusion into my [`z`](https://github.com/rwxrob/z) Bonzai stateful command tree. The name `good` is so that I can also be used as a standalone `good` binary without conflict even though I have `go` as an alias for it.

If you just want to try it out, grab the release binary with `curl` and put into your PATH:

```
curl -L https://github.com/rwxrob/good/releases/latest/download/good-linux-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/good
curl -L https://github.com/rwxrob/good/releases/latest/download/good-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/good
curl -L https://github.com/rwxrob/good/releases/latest/download/good-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/good
curl -L https://github.com/rwxrob/good/releases/latest/download/good-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/good
```
